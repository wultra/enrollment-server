## Enumerations

### Form Attribute Types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `AMOUNT` | Form field representing an amount with currency. |
| `KEY_VALUE` | Form field representing a key value item, where items are displayed next to each other. This realistically impose limitation on value length - it should fit into the single line. |
| `NOTE` | Form field representing a generic text note, where label is displayed above the note. As a result, note can be of an arbitrary length and can be multi-line. |
| `HEADING` | Form field representing a heading, where label is displayed as the heading text. |
| `PARTY_INFO` | Form field representing a structured object with information about a third party. |

### Operation Rejection Reasons

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `UNKNOWN` | User decided not to tell us the operation rejection reason. |
| `INCORRECT_DATA` | User claims incorrect data was presented in mToken app. |
| `UNEXPECTED_OPERATION` | User claims he/she did not expect any operation. |

### Allowed Signature Types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `1FA` | One-factor signature - user just has to tap "Confirm" button to confirm it. |
| `2FA` | Two-factor signature - user needs to use either password of biometry as addition to possession factor. The `variants` key then determines what signature type is allowed for the given operation. |
| `ECDSA` | ECDSA signature with device private key. |
